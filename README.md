## Description
This is a data science project under the University of Warwick for the course EC349 Data Science for Economists. In this project, I created a prediction model in R to predict the numbers of stars user i would give to business j. The datasets used are business_data, user_data_small and review_data_small which can be obtained from Yelp's publications. Data cleaning was conducted to obtain a final usable dataframe, first for sentiment analysis, then for random forests prediction. The test accuracy attained by the model was approximately 48%.
